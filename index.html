							This was my first complete course at coding blocks. I attended the Python course in Winter 2020 and loved it which made me join the full course. Shubham bhaiya and Ayush Bhaiya(TA) have good knowledge about the field and were very helpful in making us understand the concepts. I would certainly recommend this to anyone...
